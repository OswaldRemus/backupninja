backupninja (0.9.7-1) UNRELEASED

	* mysql: output filenames to support shell meta-characters in
	  database names. This change was not heavily tested, please
	  report any breakage.
	* pgsql: output filenames to support shell meta-characters in
	  database names. This change was not heavily tested, please
	  report any breakage.

backupninja (0.9.4-1) UNRELEASED

	* duplicity: Old (pre-0.9.4) example.dup file used to give false
	  information about the way the GnuPG-related options are used.
	  Please read the new /usr/share/doc/backupninja/examples/example.dup
	  file, and update your own configuration files if needed.

	* duplicity, rdiff: symlinks and globbing support in
	  include/exclude/vsinclude was unclear and did not work in all
	  situations, with weird behavious, due to incompatibilities
	  between various readlink versions in this field. This has been made
	  clear eventually: globbing is fully supported again, whereas no
	  attempt is done to dereference symlinks anymore. 
	  Please read the new /usr/share/doc/backupninja/examples/example.dup
	  or /usr/share/doc/backupninja/examples/example.rdiff file, and update
	  your own configuration files if needed.

	* duplicity: duplicity now uses sftp, which does not support all scp
	  command line options; you thus have to convert the sshoptions setting
	  in your *.dup configuration files, to sftp-compatible syntax; for
	  example, you can replace:
	    sshoptions = -i /root/.ssh/id_dsa_duplicity
	  with:
	    sshoptions = -o IdentityFile=/root/.ssh/id_dsa_duplicity
